RGBY-ROM Post Completion Thoughts.

Fixes/Additions:
	Add a dedicated debug port to the PCB. JTAG or otherwise.
	Sensor bar motion system and data cartrigde mount should be a tighter unit for 
		better sensor to acrylic nit tolerance control.
	Add brightness control to the data cartridge white LED strip backlight.

HDL/Software:
	UART or JTAG data debug port should be added to read out the RAM post data cartridge read
		and compared to assembler provided HEX to ensure data integrity over many read cycles of 
		the data cartridge.
	Assembler requires a more robust text editor for simple undo/redo opperations.

Aesthetics:
	Adjust the motion system cutout to match the data cartridge (align bottoms).
