# RGBY-ROM

RGBY-ROM reads data cartridges comprised of red, green, blue, and yellow acrylic squares where each square acts as 2 bits of program data. The the program is then excuted on a custom simple CPU architecture instantiated on a FPGA to control a RGB LED and 8 LED indicators.

RGBY-ROM uses the TinyFPGA Bx as the FPGA board.

The TinyFPGA uses the ATOM IDE with the APIO extension.

The HDL is Verilog.
